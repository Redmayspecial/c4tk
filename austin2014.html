        </header>
        <p>Every person has something unique to contribute to the community, society, and church. Yet, less than 20% of us are actively engaged in doing what we could do. Most of us do not understand how we can leverage our skills and ideas to improve the lives of others.

What if we could discover how to use our unique gifts for God’s Kingdom? Build technologies to mobilize and equip every member of your community, church and family. Empower them to release their skills as well as to accelerate great ideas and initiatives that could transform the lives of the child or adult down your street.</p></section>

          <h3>SPIRITUAL JUSTICE</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Every person has the right to receive God’s Word and discover His unconditional love, because only God’s truth has the ability to transform the heart and the mind. Join forces with other like minded individuals and create technologies that help reduce spiritual poverty in every nation, city, community, family, and individual.

Build mobile applications to help children learn the Word of God, bury it in their hearts and share it with their friends. Create technologies for prayer, evangelism, mentorship, and other innovative means to spiritual formation.

        <p>The Church and non-profits are always significantly underfunded. The Great Commission could be tremendously impacted and enhanced if financial resources were available. What better opportunity than this to cultivate generosity with Generis? Build fresh user experiences that can help organizations redefine the giving experience for their patrons.  Leverage the power of technology to encourage individuals and families to become generous to the causes and churches.

    <h3>Absent Fathers</h3> 
  </div>
  <div class="9u challenge-description">
    <div class="expander intro">
      <span class="toggle-switch"></span>
      How can technology help alleviate and/or combat the effects of fatherlessness in a child’s life, in turn strengthening families, reducing poverty and crime? 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
<p>Fatherlessness is epidemic, affecting one out of every 4 children in the United States. According to the US Census and other data, fatherless children represent: 75% of adolescent patients in chemical abuse centers, 85% of youths in prisons, 63% of youth suicides, 90% of all homeless and runaway children, 85% of all children who show behavior disorders, 71% of all high school dropouts. Fatherless children are four times more likely to be poor, and at least twice as like to be involved in criminal activity.</p>
<p>What if technology could foster ways by which every fatherless family could receive love, opportunities, mentorship, support, kindness, healthy relationships, and genuine acceptance from others?</p>

<p>For over 80 years the Bible has been suppressed in China. But now it is being made available broadly and freely across technology platforms. Yet, the Chinese people are largely unaware of The Bible’s availability.</p>
<p>How can we let the entire Chinese nation become aware that they have access to the Bible? How can we allow Chinese Christians to share scripture with others? How can we use technology to accelerate the presentation of The Gospel in China?</p>

      How can technology promote worldwide biblical literacy? How can technology help people with limited reading skills to understand and engage the Bible? 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
<p>50% of the world is illiterate and will never be reached with the printed page. And yet, every person has the right to receive God’s Word in their own language because, only God’s truth has the ability to transform the heart and the mind.</p>
<p>Even among the literate, biblical content in their heart language may be scarce and even in languages where there is an abundance of content, many people are not biblically literate.</p>
<p>How can technology promote worldwide biblical literacy? How can technology help people with limited reading skills to understand and engage the Bible?</p>
<p>There is such a thing as “heart language.” These are the thoughts in your head, the phrases you naturally repeat, the songs that make their way from your lips into your psyche. Most of these are first heard with our ears and repeated with our lips.</p>
<p>For the first time in history the Bible in text, audio and video has now been normalized and made available via APIs so YOU can reach 5.7 billion people in over 800 languages. Through the Digital Bible Platform you can integrate the Bible in all of your most effective digital evangelism, discipleship and engagement tools? Faith Comes By Hearing is looking for the most creative ways to apply this platform to reach the World! And they want to support you all the way to accomplish this.</p>
<p>What if people around the world could remember the whole counsel of God in their heart language? Can believers have the promises, reasoning, implications, songs and stories of Scripture readily available in their hearts and minds instead of simply on their smartphones or bookshelves?</p>
<p>Can we build oral translation technology to help multilingual churches thrive and promote the witness of a united church that spans language and cultural barriers?</p>
<p>Can we invent tools that empower people to create multilingual video and audio content that engages people who are not proficient readers with the Scriptures?</p>

      How can technology help Small Groups prosper and grow by providing facilitation mechanisms? 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
<p>Small Groups help us nurture our faith, and build stronger relationships. In small groups, every participant should be seen and heard, we can ask questions, participate discussions, and share insights. Yet, as small groups grow the need for structure during the meeting also grows, so all can be heard and the meeting kept on track.</p>
<p>What if there was a Small Group Facilitation app that would help the Small Groups Leaders and Participants, as well as Church leadership, plan, execute and stay on track with the purpose and design for the particular group?</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>
      A hackathon is an event where people get together and develop some awesome technologies in a short time span. Think of it as a creative marathon where at the end you have some product to show for.

  <div class="content">
    <p>
      This Hackathon is a non-profit event to encourage the activation and on-going collaboration of a larger ecosystem of all sort of creative individuals ( including programmers, designers, creatives, entrepreneurs, and leaders of churches, non-profits, and the marketplace) who are passionate about creating technologies to tackle from a Christian perspective the challenges confronting our society, our communities, our churches, and our spiritual lives.

  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">I can’t stay whole 24 hours, can I still participate?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      Yes. We realize that 47 hours is a long time, and that some people might have other commitments, or might prefer to work remotely, or need to go home/hotel to rest and shower. Yet, you need to be present for the initial few hours during the startup demos, and at some point you need be at the venue and do some work onsite. You will also need to be present for the final few hours for the presentations and judging.
    </p>

  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Can I sleep at the venue?</span></div>

    <p>
      Yes the venue will be open for the duration of the event, please bring a sleeping bag, a pillow, or whatever you might need, and find a place at the venue to take a good nap.

  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Will I meet my team members before the event?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      Possibly. You can use the Code for the Kingdom Google + Community at anytime to meet other participants, propose ideas, and recruit or be recruited into a team. But you can also bring your own team, or come alone and become part of a team at the hackathon.
    </p>
  </div>

</div>


  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Can I present a technology I already have?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      You can build on top of something you have, but whatever you present must have new code developed for at least one of the challenges of the hackathon and you must do some of that coding at the hackathon venue during the hackathon hours.
    </p>
  </div>
  <hr/>

  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Won’t other teams who are building on top of technologies they already developed, not have an unfair advantage over me who plans to start coding during the actual hackathon hours?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      We don’t think so. There will be separate prizes, but of similar amount, for teams that present solutions built on their existing technologies, and for teams that start fresh at the hackathon. We want to honor all of you, regardless of whether you have been working for a while on something you are passionate about, or whether you decide on something brand new.

  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Do I have to work non-stop?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      No. The work space will be available non-stop ( the entire hackathon 47 ) but it is up to you and your team to decide on your work schedule.

  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Who owns the IP of what we make?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      This is ultimately a question for your team. But neither the organizers nor Code for the Kingdom claims any ownership of any technologies you develop.
