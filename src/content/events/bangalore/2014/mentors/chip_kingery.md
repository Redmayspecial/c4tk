Rev. Dr. Chip Kingery hails from the U.S.— an American by birth, but Indian by choice!  He has lived in Asia for over 30 years; 25 of those in Bangalore— where he directed programs for World Hunger Relief. In 1986, Chip and Jean began proVISION ASIA, an NGO focused on all aspects of disability ministry: education, referrals for operations, provision of mobility aids, family and individual counseling, job-placement, physiotherapy and government advocacy. proVISION ASIA runs a school, Mithra Special School; and has created a wheelchair refurbishment unit in the Bangalore Central Prison— and will soon operate the first mobile diabetes clinic in south India. Their passion, along with 16 staff members here in Bangalore, is to give a hand up— not a hand out, to people with disabilities; and to provide Abundant Life for these friends
