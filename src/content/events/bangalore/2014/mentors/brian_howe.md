Brian supports entrepreneurs in structuring, launching, and scaling ideas. He is our CEO, as well as the town crier who started yelling about Impact Hub Seattle a few years ago, and has loved watching the village help raise it. Currently, he wakes up in the middle of the night thinking about how this space, community, and resources can best inspire entrepreneurs to build ventures worthy of their full humanity.Prior to launching Impact Hub, he founded Vox Legal PLLC, a law firm that specialized in setting up structures for social ventures, start-ups, and nonprofits.  He loves to teach and gets to do so at a few graduate universities, talking about business, social justice, and possibility. He currently serves as an entrepreneur-in-residence at the UW Center for Commercialization, an advisor to Fledge.co and SiFP.net, a board member with Arts Aftercare and Realize Impact, of counsel with Apex Law Group, and as a partner with VenturScale. He's never happier than when cooking with his wife, hanging out on a rooftop with friends, or playing with his nephews.
