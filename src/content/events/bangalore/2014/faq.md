    Yes. We realize that 46 hours is a long time, and that some people might have other commitments, or might prefer to work remotely, or need to go home/hotel to rest and shower. Yet, you should be present for the initial few hours of the kickoff, and at some point you need be at the venue and do some work onsite. You will also need to be present for the final few hours for the project presentations and judging.

    Possibly. You can use the Code for the Kingdom Facebook Community at anytime to meet other participants, propose ideas, and recruit or be recruited into a team. But you can also bring your own team, or come alone and become part of a team at the event.
- question:
    Can I present a technology that I have already built or worked on?
  answer:
    You can build on top of something you have, but whatever you present must be in alignment with the event theme and have something new created for at least one of the challenges or projects of the event and you must do some of that work at the venue during the event hours.
- question:
    Won’t other teams who are building on top of their existing works, have an unfair advantage over people like me who plan to start creating during the actual event hours?   
  answer:
    Not at all. There will be separate prizes, but of similar amount, for teams that present projects built on their existing works, and for teams that start fresh at the event. We want to honor all of you, regardless of whether you have been working for a while on something you are passionate about, or whether you decide on something brand new.

    Do I have to work non-stop?
  answer:
    No. The work space will be available non-stop (the entire hackathon) but it is up to you and your team to decide on your work schedule.

    This is ultimately a question for your team. But neither the local organizers nor Code for the Kingdom will claim any ownership of anything that you develop.
