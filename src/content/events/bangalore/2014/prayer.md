## <i class="icon fa-male"></i> 47 HOUR PRAYER ROOM

Our skills are not sufficient to tackle the challenges our society faces. We know the first step must be prayer. As David took down Goliath with the power of God, so we need this same guidance. Thus, for every hour of this event we're asking people from across the Austin area, and the participants to take some time out, and join us in prayer in a 47 hour prayer room onsite at the event venue.
