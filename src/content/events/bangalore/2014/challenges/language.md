50% of the world is illiterate and will never be reached with the printed page. And yet, every person has the right to receive God’s Word in their own language because, only God’s truth has the ability to transform the heart and the mind.

Even among the literate, biblical content in their heart language may be scarce and even in languages where there is an abundance of content, many people are not biblically literate.

There is such a thing as “heart language.” These are the thoughts in your head, the phrases you naturally repeat, the songs that make their way from your lips into your psyche. Most of these are first heard with our ears and repeated with our lips.

What if people around the world could remember the whole counsel of God in their heart language? Can believers have the promises, reasoning, implications, songs and stories of Scripture readily available in their hearts and minds instead of simply on their smartphones or bookshelves?

Can we build oral translation technology to help multilingual churches thrive and promote the witness of a united church that spans language and cultural barriers?

Can we invent tools that empower people to create multilingual video and audio content that engages people who are not proficient readers with the Scriptures?

Consider leveraging the Digital Bible Platform API to bring the Bible in text, audio and video to over 5.7 billion people in over 800 languages.
