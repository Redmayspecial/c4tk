According to UNICEF, 51% of men in India believe wife beating can be justified. And, incredibly enough 54.4% of women in India also believe in justified wife beatings. When violence justification is such a cultural belief, it is not a surprise that most women in India do not feel safe in public spaces. One rape happens every 30 minutes in India, according to the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative. 

There is no doubt that regardless of social-economic advances, stopping violence against women and girls requires spiritual and cultural transformation that only Jesus can bring. Jesus commands us to love our neighbor as ourselves. He said that is the second most important commandment, and it is that love that will stop the violence. 

How can we help leverage technological advances so that all women and children in India can live freely without fear of crimes or atrocities against them? How can technology help alert, connect and protect God's precious people before any chance of crime can befall them?  How can technology encourage men in India to stand against the violence towards women? How can technology help change a culture where neighbors commit acts of violence, condemnation, or indifference towards women, into a culture where neighbors love neighbors and protect the woman and girl down the street?
