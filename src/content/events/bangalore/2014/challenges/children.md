Did you know that more than 80% of Christians choose Christ between the ages of 4-14?  Children are the biggest mission field, and they have impressionable young minds that are fertile ground for the Word of God.

Build a mobile application to help children learn the word of God, bury it in their hearts and share it with their friends in a fun, interactive, and engaging way, using the platforms they're already using while making the Bible more "awesome" and "cool" than Angry Birds, Temple Run, and Candy Crush.
