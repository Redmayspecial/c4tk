Small Groups help us nurture our faith, and build stronger relationships. In small groups, every participant should be seen and heard, we can ask questions, participate discussions, and share insights. Yet, as small groups grow the need for structure during the meeting also grows, so all can be heard and the meeting kept on track.

What if there was a Small Group Facilitation app that would help the Small Groups Leaders and Participants, as well as Church leadership, plan, execute and stay on track with the purpose and design for the particular group?
