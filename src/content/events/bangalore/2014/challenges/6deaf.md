Deaf people are one of the most unengaged people groups with the Gospel. It has been said that the global deaf population represents the fourth largest unreached group. Some statistics point out that less than 2% of deaf people call themselves Christian.  Create technology, films, and games to reach and engage the deaf with the Gospel, Christian mentors, Christian initiatives, and churches.
