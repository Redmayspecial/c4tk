There’s a growing body of evidence that directly connects pornography to human trafficking and sexual slavery. In fact, 1 in 5 pornographic images online involve child victims of sex trafficking. Traffickers are using technology to exploit people more effectively than the organizations who are trying to protect and rescue them.

Human trafficking is the fastest growing criminal enterprise in the world, and the second largest after the global drug trade! There are an estimated 27 million people in slavery around the world, which is more than any other time in history. The average age of entry into prostitution in the United States is 12-14 years old.

Human trafficking has become one of the key issues of our time and people in every sector of society are rising up to end modern day slavery. Meanwhile, pornography is on the rise. The average age of first exposure to porn is 11 years old. 93% of boys and 62% of girls are exposed to porn before they turn 18, and 70% of 18-24 year old young men view porn monthly. Within the church, 50% of men and 20% of women are addicted to porn, and 37% of pastors say that it’s a current struggle.

What if a choice to view porn, was actually a choice to promote and condone sexual slavery? In a day when at least 1 in 5 porn images is a child victim of sex trafficking and 88% of all porn contains acts of physical violence or aggression, the line between porn and human trafficking is rapidly diminishing

Can you create technology to affect Demand Reduction?

This effort would focus on getting fewer men to buy sex and consume pornography by disrupting online channels to pornography and sex by presenting alternative messages to men, including targeted search ads (Google, Bing, etc.), banner/page ads (on Backpage, MyProviderGuide, etc), and social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram). This intervention could include information about where men can get help/counseling, the harmful effects of sex buying on trafficking/prostitution survivors, and possible consequences (legal, social, health) of buying sex.

Build technology for Victim Outreach

This consists of sending messages crafted by survivors of prostitution to ads online selling sex. Email and text replies are then received by survivor services organizations which are able to follow-up with information for support.

Use technology for Awareness & Victim Identification

Blanket awareness efforts on signs of possible trafficking through online channels and social media platforms to drive identification and reporting.

Create technology to produce better data for the Anti-Trafficking Movement

The current state of information and quality data in the anti-trafficking movement is limited at best. Develop an open dashboard to help existing organization leverage and share the data they do have in meaningful ways both internally and across the non-profit, law enforcement, and government ecosystem. Social media or other web data could be valuable for detecting popular sentiment about pornography and prostitution, or perhaps even detecting instances of illicit activity that’s difficult to track by conventional means.
