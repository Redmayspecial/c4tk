When a major restaurant chain looks into expansion in the city, they have market research to understand everything about how that community is being served by others. They know who is serving the community, what they serve, where they serve, who they serve, how they are serving, and how the community perceives the service.

How can Christian ministries do the same? How can a comprehensive, up to date, asset based map be created to provides a holistic map of resources, needs, efforts, and gaps? The goal would be to foster collaboration, improve service quality, and focus giving to the areas where it can be most effective.

How can technology be used to identify, promote, evaluate, collaborate, augment, and fill the gaps of ministry programs around the city?

Imagine a real time map to track every ministry initiative in the city. Imagine the crowd providing information about who is doing what, and how they are serving the community. Imagine a Yelp for Ministry with some level of quality control to vet the entries.

Now imagine, as an example, tracking children ministry efforts in a city:

    Help direct children to locations where they can be taught and show gaps where ministry in unavailable.
    Data could be categorized by type of ministry and number of children typically involved, including overlays of population and youth statistics
    Enable leaders to check in with category and numbers. Frequency of check in at location would communicate frequency/consistency of ministry provision.
    Help potential volunteers and funders find local community opportunities to contribute.
    Helps families learn where the nearest sports ministry or literacy training or grief counseling for children is available.
    Also begins to show where new initiatives and resources might be strategically directed.
    When gaps are found, there could be an aspect of a Christian Kickstarter.com the Church. All ideas funded are not for profit but rather to fill an area of need in the world of ministry

Then imagine similar possibilities for any type of ministry.
