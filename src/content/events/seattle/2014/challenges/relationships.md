So much as been written and researched about how technology, and social media in particular, has changed us as a society and as individuals. While there are many benefits that can be harnessed from these technologies, there are also many ways that these technologies have negatively affected us. One area that has been profoundly shaped by recent technology is community.

How can we leverage technology to create, cultivate and strengthen some of society’s most foundational relationships–marriage, family, friendships?

For example, can you build an app that helps husbands and wives build gospel-centered marriages?

Can you create a social network that fosters mentoring relationships between generations?

How about games or apps for latchkey kids to stay connected and avoid loneliness, boredom, and fear?

Can you make a game that includes children in the lives of their itinerant parents? Can you building an app for a parent who travels to develop closeness with child. Child gives parent the traveling challenge. e.g. photos of something from: each letter in child’s name numbers of phone number or street address what you liked best in the hotel you stayed the funniest thing you heard?

Researcher John Gottman says the best thing we can do is have a 6 second kiss every day with your spouse. Can you create the technology equivalent to the six-second kiss?
