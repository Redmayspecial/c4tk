So you are a homeless kid, living in your car with your sister and mom. How is mom supposed to submit applications to housing providers to get into a shelter or transitional housing? She can’t send or receive faxed applications. She doesn’t have the $5 to send it to RiteAid or Bartels… She doesn’t have the gas money to go pick one up. She doesn’t have a mailing address so we can’t send her one… and even if she did, she can’t get to the post office to pay for it and mail it… BUT!! She can get to the library or a service center to fill out the form online and submit it!

Right now organizations serving the homeless, like Vision House, are using paper forms , that they try to fax, mail or email to the homeless client. Yet, it is really difficult for the homeless to get it back to them for the reasons above.

Furthermore, the homeless has to fill a separate application to every single organization, increasing their frustration and despair, while at the same time creating more work and inefficiencies for the organizations which are working from separate applications queues that contain many of the same homeless cases.
What if there was an online free service that would allow the homeless to complete a single form, and update when their information changes, which then would go in a service queue from which all organizations providing housing will pull from? What if that service allows better communication with the homeless, and between agencies? What else can that service do to bring the hope that is Christ and the generosity of our communities to positively affect the life of the homeless child down your street?

What if the service had a mobile app that church volunteers can leverage to go on the street and help homeless people apply for housing? What if by providing such mobile app, you could foster an “adopt a corner” movement by which a Christian would take responsibility for bringing the application process to the homeless person on that corner? What if those “adopt a corner” volunteers can also help the homeless update their information on the mobile app?
