 Vision is an eyeglasses inventory management app for volunteer optometrists working on short-term medical aid trips to the developing world. Vision matches patients with donated eyeglasses, but instead of the traditional eye-chart for eye exams, Vision integrates with Faith Comes By Hearing’s Digital Bible Platform to provide Bible verses in the particular native language as the eye exam tool.
