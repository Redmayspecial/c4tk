This app was created in response to the “Helping the homeless” challenge from the hackathon: “How can technology help a homeless person or family find a home? How can technology equip leaders in their homeless ministry and increase their reach and impact?”
 
 In Seattle, as in most large cities where multiple agencies work every day to help provide housing for the homeless, it is difficult for the homeless to apply for housing and for organizations to coordinate their work and applications queues. The IKOS team decided to help the homeless and homeless ministry by creating a digital universal housing application that connects organizations with the homeless. Their solution allows anyone with a smartphone to help a homeless person apply for housing in all the city’s homeless ministries…at once. 

Team Members: Jim Speaker, Chris Maher, Chip Dong, Andre Smith, Ramin Sedighi, Brandon Camerer.
