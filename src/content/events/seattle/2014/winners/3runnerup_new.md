intro: MinMap 
---
MinMap or Ministry Mapping is a mobile and web-based application used by individuals in ministry to help identify where services are being provided, and where they are needed, simply by checking-in. The data from these check-ins will be served in an online database. Ministries can see where services remain unfulfilled, find others to partner with in solutions, and to inform other organizations of the work they are doing. MinMap is for the church of 100 in the small town of 5000. MinMap is for the missions organization working in 120 countries. MinMap is for the budget-strapped municipality that doesn’t have the funds or capabilities to research what is going on in their city.
