title: Best Use of Digital Bible Platform 
intro: Speak The Word 
---
You speak a word or phrase into this app and using speech recognition, the app searches in your language the Faith Comes By Hearing’s Digital Bible Platform to identify Bible verses that relate to that word or phrase. The app then suggests to you one or more related verses from The Bible. You can play those verses, save them, memorize them, or even forward them to a family member or friend to encourage them with The Word.
