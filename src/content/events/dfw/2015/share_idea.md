If you have an idea or project that you’ve been wanting to work on then this is the perfect opportunity to work on it. We are working diligently to bring together a pool of resources from programmers to business mentors to help take your idea to the next stage.
To submit your idea, follow the instructions below and begin building out your team early, and get us working to recruit and match all the resources you’ll need:
<ol style="list-style-position:inside; list-style-type:decimal"><li>Tweet a quick summary of your idea  to [@code4thekingdom](https://twitter.com/code4thekingdom) with the hashtag #C4TKDallas.</li><li>The organizing team will create a Trello board for you to post a more detailed description of your idea, add team members, share documents and coordinate before and during the event. (You’ll be able to sign up for a free account if you don’t already have one.)</li><li>Teams will be able to submit ideas for Friday night pitches until Wednesday, March 18th.</li><li>Ideas submitted after Wednesday March 18th will present during the “Open Pitches”- where attendees will have a 1-minute pitch opportunity.*</li></ol> 

*Don’t be afraid to pitch your idea! Some of the best technologies come from a moment of inspiration. Mentors will be waiting to help you articulate your idea/product, and match you with resources throughout the weekend.

Don’t have an idea? No problem! There will be plenty of ideas and opportunities for you to join a team.
Whether you’re a computer programming student, budding entrepreneur, coding prodigy/superhero, or just a person who loves technology… this is the time to come together, build relationships, solve problems, and worship through creation and innovation for the Kingdom.
So come share your ideas and/or build your project in a highly-collaborative, resource rich environment with other believers! We’ll take care of the mentors, food, and energy you need to make it happen.
