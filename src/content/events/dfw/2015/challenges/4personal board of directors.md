Christian thought leaders like Jim Collins and Bob Buford have talked for years about the need for every Christian to build a Personal Board of Directors. Such board is a smal group of trusted advisors who speak into your life from a Christian point of view, and who are the people you can turn to in time of decision making and difficult situations? We all know that technology can help foster better connection, but large social networks do not foster the type of intimate, private, and deep relationships that are needed to support such a delicate thing as a Personal Board of Directors. Perhaps, micro social networks, designed with a Christian perspective for small groups of your closest friends, could truly help every Christian to have such board. How would you use your skills to help foster such a cultural swift?
