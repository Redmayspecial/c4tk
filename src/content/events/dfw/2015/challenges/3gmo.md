We all understand that the best way to serve people is by meeting them where they are. Global Media Outreach is serving the millions of people each day that search on the Internet for a spiritual term. Tens of thousands (and growing) of Online Missionaries (OMs) are in place to respond to those asking for help via the Internet.  With Over-The-Top instant messaging services ( such as WhatsApp, Kik, and many others), becoming more and more the preferred means of communication when the person searching is concerned about SMS costs, OMs must have a unified way to be in contact with the people they serve, regardless of which OTT messaging apps each party is using.
