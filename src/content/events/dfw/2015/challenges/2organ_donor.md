Currently in the US alone, according to the national data (http://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/converge/latestData/step2.asp) by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, there are over 120,000 people waiting for organ transplants and only about 14,000 donors. In addition, 82% of the waiting list is for kidneys. But what if the right technology at the hand of churches across the country could serve to educate, engage, and recruit Christians to give the gift of life and double the number of donors? 

How can you affect the life of the person in your community who needs a new kidney, and his/her family? What if technology allowed the opportunity to become a donor to be present every time someone interacts with her/his church digital tools, instead of every few years during driver license renewal?
