“Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you…” James 4:8, ESV. It is an amazing time to live in, and technology allows us to draw near to God with an array of Digital tools. With many Bible apps already out there, what can we now do to drive scripture engagement? Is it with a gamification, witnessing apps to share with others, or maybe it’s something that you have been dreaming about? We call upon you, with your God given gifts and abilities to create engaging Biblical tools for the kingdom of God, using our Digital Bible Platform API and its over 870 languages. Help us increase scripture engagement to quench thirsts, clothe spiritually, and equip mentally with the power of the Bible, in a language people understand. http://www.digitalbibleplatform.com/.
