Technology has become the predominant tool of sex traffickers. The ease by which they can acquire mobile phones and new numbers, allows the traffickers to coordinate meeting points, terms of the transaction, and to maintain communication with the victims and the “johns”. Escort websites and online classified ad sites provide the traffickers with countless opportunities to conduct their businesses and publish those mobile numbers. But what if you were to create technology that would take the very same information traffickers advertise, and use it to direct so much traffic to their mobile phones to the point their main means of communication becomes useless?
