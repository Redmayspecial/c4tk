###What is Code for the Kingdom?

Technology is a powerful tool that can help eradicate injustice, teach about God’s word, and strengthen the Church. What if you could be a part of building this kind of technology that can be used to change lives?

That is what Code for the Kingdom is all about. Partner with like-minded people who are changing lives by tackling real-world issues from a Christian perspective. 

One common thing we hear from the Christian community is “But I’m not a (Programmer, Hacker, Visionary, Business Leader, Designer, Professional Genius, etc.) What would I have to offer?”

You are more talented than you’re giving yourself credit for! We all strive to live our lives in service to the Kingdom. This is your chance to live that out in a weekend of focused collaboration! Each person brings unique perspective, passion, and expertise to the table. When like-minded people come together, incredible things can happen. 

Join us in March for a weekend hackathon at The Addison Treehouse in Addison, TX where you will be able to meet and work together with people who are serious about using technology to further the Kingdom.

          <h3>ENGAGING AND RELEASING OUR BEST</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Every person has something unique to contribute to the community, society, and church. Yet, less than 20% of us are actively engaged in doing what we could do. Most of us do not understand how we can leverage our skills and ideas to improve the lives of others.

What if we could discover how to use our unique gifts for God’s Kingdom? Build technologies to mobilize and equip every member of your community, church and family. Empower them to release their skills as well as to accelerate great ideas and initiatives that could transform the lives of the child or adult down your street.</p></section>

          <h3>SPIRITUAL FORMATION</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Every person has the right to receive God’s Word and discover His unconditional love, because only God’s truth has the ability to transform the heart and the mind. Join forces with other like minded individuals and create technologies that help reduce spiritual poverty in every nation, city, community, family, and individual.

Build mobile applications to help children learn the Word of God, bury it in their hearts and share it with their friends. Create technologies for prayer, evangelism, mentorship, and other innovative means to spiritual formation.

          <h3>HELP CREATE A CULTURE OF GENEROSITY</h3>
        </header>
        <p>The Church and non-profits are always significantly underfunded. The Great Commission could be tremendously impacted and enhanced if financial resources were available.  Build fresh user experiences that can help organizations redefine the giving experience for their patrons.  Leverage the power of technology to encourage individuals and families to become generous to the causes and churches.

How can technology alleviate the social maladies that oppress so many? How can you help knock off a little corner of darkness?

<blockquote>“To be loved but not known is comforting but superficial. To be known and not loved is our greatest fear. But to be fully known and truly loved is, well, a lot like being loved by God. It is what we need more than anything. It liberates us from pretense, humbles us out of our self-righteousness, and fortifies us for any difficulty life can throw at us.” - Timothy Keller</blockquote>
