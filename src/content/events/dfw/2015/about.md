###What is Code for the Kingdom?

Technology is a powerful tool that can help eradicate injustice, teach about God’s word, and strengthen the Church. What if you could be a part of building this kind of technology that can be used to change lives?

That is what Code for the Kingdom is all about. Partner with like-minded people who are changing lives by tackling real-world issues from a Christian perspective. 

One common thing we hear from the Christian community is “But I’m not a (Programmer, Hacker, Visionary, Business Leader, Designer, Professional Genius, etc.) What would I have to offer?”

You are more talented than you’re giving yourself credit for! We all strive to live our lives in service to the Kingdom. This is your chance to live that out in a weekend of focused collaboration! Each person brings unique perspective, passion, and expertise to the table. When like-minded people come together, incredible things can happen. 

Join us in March for a weekend hackathon at The Addison Treehouse in Addison, TX where you will be able to meet and work together with people who are serious about using technology to further the Kingdom.

          <h3>ENGAGING AND RELEASING OUR BEST</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Every person has something unique to contribute to the community, society, and church. Yet, less than 20% of us are actively engaged in doing what we could do. Most of us do not understand how we can leverage our skills and ideas to improve the lives of others.

What if we could discover how to use our unique gifts for God’s Kingdom? Build technologies to mobilize and equip every member of your community, church and family. Empower them to release their skills as well as to accelerate great ideas and initiatives that could transform the lives of the child or adult down your street.</p></section>

          <h3>SPIRITUAL FORMATION</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Every person has the right to receive God’s Word and discover His unconditional love, because only God’s truth has the ability to transform the heart and the mind. Join forces with other like minded individuals and create technologies that help reduce spiritual poverty in every nation, city, community, family, and individual.

Build mobile applications to help children learn the Word of God, bury it in their hearts and share it with their friends. Create technologies for prayer, evangelism, mentorship, and other innovative means to spiritual formation.

          <h3>HELP CREATE A CULTURE OF GENEROSITY</h3>
        </header>
        <p>We are all called to a life of generous sacrifice extending beyond simple financial generosity, to include generosity of our mind, love, time and possessions. If the Kingdom of God is to truly to be advanced by us, we need to answer the call of generosity. It is only when we live out this radical generosity that the Church will be unleashed in thoughtfulness, action, and resources to advance the Kingdom of God in the world. Create technology to encourage individuals and families to become generous in every aspect of their lives.</p>

        <p>How will you knock off a little corner of darkness in the world? What technologies can you create that will alleviate the social maladies that oppress so many? Work with non-profits to help rescue victims of human trafficking, combat poverty, lift the fatherless, release the oppressed, heal the sick and feed the hungry. Use your skills to create a brighter world and lift up your community.What technologies can you create to affect the life of one lost child in your own neighborhood?

<blockquote>“To be loved but not known is comforting but superficial. To be known and not loved is our greatest fear. But to be fully known and truly loved is, well, a lot like being loved by God. It is what we need more than anything. It liberates us from pretense, humbles us out of our self-righteousness, and fortifies us for any difficulty life can throw at us.” - Timothy Keller</blockquote>
