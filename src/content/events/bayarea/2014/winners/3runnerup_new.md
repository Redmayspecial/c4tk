intro: Faith Comes by Phone
---
Reaching the minority percentage with a Gospel they understand. 93% of the world can be reached by a mobile phone. The majority of those users have a smartphone. But what about those who have yet to get a smartphone? That’s where Faith Comes By Phone comes in. It is a call-back service that allows for scriptures to be sent to people by phone. Since incoming calls are free in most countries, Faith Comes By Phone, gives users a code that that “call in”. After the initial call is made with that code, the user receives an incoming call that begins speaking scripture in that person’s native language.
