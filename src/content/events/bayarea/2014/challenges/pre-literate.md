One of OneHope’s most successful ways of spreading the Gospel is through their 17 Stories curriculum. They reach hundreds of thousands of children all over the world each year through this set of 16 trading cards that capture the metanarrative of the Bible. Children receive one card each week they attend, and when all the cards are assembled in the right order, the backs of the cards create one whole image that shows how the children are included and a part of the whole story of the Bible. This program has proved highly successful in attracting children to return to local church programming on a regular basis, and is also effective in outreach to pre-literate audiences.

Do not feel constrained to attempt to duplicate the experience with these physical cards. Rather, use what One Hope has created as a starting point and explore new ways that these cards, images and stories could be used in a mobile digital context to reach children.
