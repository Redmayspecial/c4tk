title: Digital Volunteer Record 
intro: What if there was a way for individuals to carry a digital “volunteer record” that would allow ministry leaders to see their background checks, gifts, skills, endorsements, past ministry and volunteering experience, etc, fast tracking their involvement in ministry?

Because of the transient nature of our culture, churches have many new members walking through their doors each year. Many of these members have experience and expertise in volunteer ministry that is often left idle due to complicated approval processes, poor follow up, and an overall lack of information sharing.

A Digital Volunteer Record could not only shorten the on-boarding time and simplify the process required to engage new members in ministry, but it could also cut down on a lot of duplicate administrative work that is often done in large churches where the same information needs to be collected and shared across multiple ministries. This Electronic Record would not be limited to church activities but it could be used for all type of volunteerism.
