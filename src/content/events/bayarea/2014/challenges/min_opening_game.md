Research OneHope conducted in Europe this year showed that a startlingly high percentage of youth were entirely disinterested in God, discussing Him, learning more, or reading material concerning God; it was all completely out of the question for them. In an environment like that, we cannot start with the Bible, or even a contextualized version of the Gospel. Instead, we need a game for a secular audience that is fun, challenging, and subtly brings users to reexamine their own presuppositions about the world, open the door and spark a curiosity that could lead to a willingness to listen to what the Bible has to say.

Even if all you build is a framework, or a concept or an intro video or a single level that can be developed further, that would be a great start in only 48 hours.
