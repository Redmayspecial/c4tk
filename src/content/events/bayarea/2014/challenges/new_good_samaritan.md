title: The New Good Samaritan
intro: Can you create technology that would foster a new Good Samaritan personal ethos, in which each and every one of us would have the tools to see, hear, report, and help met the spiritual and physical needs of others?

There are initiatives and technologies empowering churches and non-profits to help meet the needs of people in their communities. But what if instead of thousands of churches and non-profits taking the lead, it was millions of individuals all over the world doing so as part of their lifestyle? Imagine how many more people would be served and lifted.

How many times have some many of us walked by the Tenderloin district not really seeing the ones in need. Whether you are volunteer or not, you could record the need, pinpoint the location, report it to local charities like San Francisco City Impact, and collaborate with SFCI to activate your friends, and any individual and any organization that can help meet the need of that individual. Whether it is a prayer request, a pair of glasses, warm clothes, housing, or any other need, the ability to set change in motion would switch to each one of us.
