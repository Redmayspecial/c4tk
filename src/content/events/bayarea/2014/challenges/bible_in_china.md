For over 80 years the Bible has been suppressed in China. But now it is being made available broadly and freely across technology platforms. Yet, the Chinese people are largely unaware of The Bibleâ€™s availability.

How can we let the entire Chinese nation become aware that they have access to the Bible? How can we allow Chinese Christians to share scripture with others? How can we use technology to accelerate the presentation of The Gospel in China?
