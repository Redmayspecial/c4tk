Christian Huang serves as the Executive Director at SF City Impact, a non-profit organization that started in 1984 in the inner-city of San Francisco. In 2011, Christian resigned from his national sales position in health care after receiving a call from a friend who survived being sex-trafficked only four blocks away from SFCI’s main campus.

Through SFCI’s Rescue Mission, Health & Wellness Center, Food Bank, Elementary School, Volunteer Center, Adopt a Building, Church, and Social Enterprises, they are intervening in both the lives of the people in the inner-city and the volunteers they mobilize to serve. They believe San Francisco is an epicenter where SFCI’s model of ministry can be scaled and deployed to other inner cities throughout the nation.

Christian, his wife Cori, and their three children live in San Francisco and have a burden to see the inner-city revived.
