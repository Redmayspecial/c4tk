Code for the Kingdom is a weekend hackathon for techies, designers, and entrepreneurial starters. Using prayer and technology, we tackle from a Christian perspective the challenges confronting our society, our churches, and our spiritual lives. Technology alone is insufficient. Yet God can use it as a tool for good. The weekend of June 28-30, 2013 more than 100 technologists will converge in San Francisco to use technology to help Kingdom-minded initiatives flourish.

          <h3>HELP CREATE A CULTURE OF GENEROSITY</h3>
        </header>
        <p>The Church and non-profits are always significantly underfunded. The Great Commission could be tremendously impacted and enhanced if financial resources were available. What better opportunity than this to cultivate generosity with Generis? Build fresh user experiences that can help organizations redefine the giving experience for their patrons.  Leverage the power of technology to encourage individuals and families to become generous to the causes and churches.
