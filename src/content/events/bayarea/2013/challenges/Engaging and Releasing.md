In too many churches the 80-20 rule is at work, where 80% of the congregation is only minimally engaged. In today’s world, most every person in a congregation has an educational or training specialty that could uniquely contribute to the life of their church. According to surveys, about 40% of a church’ membership cites the perception that their skills and ideas being undervalued by the church as the main limiting factor to their engagement. 

But what if the church truly developed a mechanism by which every individual could act upon his/her God given call?

Imagine a Kingdom Crowd Innovation Platform, one that brings together the components of Open Innovation, Collective Knowledge, Collective Creativity, Community Building, Social Engagement, and Crowd Funding.
 
Imagine it as a local church platform by which any and every member of the congregation can pitch ideas to positively affect the church, the community, society, and the Kingdom.

Imagine other members evaluating those ideas, giving them thumbs or down, and supporting them with time, talent, or treasure.

Imagine allowing the larger community to engage with the local church in such way, giving the un-churched Kingdom purpose resulting in passion for Kingdom initiatives.
