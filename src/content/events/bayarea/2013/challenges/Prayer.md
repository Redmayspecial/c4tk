Prayer is at the center of our relationship with God. It is our means of communication with Him, it strengthens us as believers and as community, and it is how we seek for what God wants for us to do. While food, water, and air sustain life, Prayer sustains our spiritual life.
As Christians we are asked to never stop praying. Yet, the busy lifestyle created by  the rapid diffusion of digital technologies like mobile phones, social networking sites, and the Internet is resulting in an ever busy lifestyle that  significantly distracts us away from Prayer.  But what if we could use the very same technologies to encourage a Prayer?

Build technologies that activate and grow the praying community relevant to me for my requests, praises and encouragement by providing a means to:

Mobilize prayer for my ministry,

Discover and respond to how God is moving in my praying community, my city and across the globe

notify affirmation, love, encouragement from a user’s praying community
