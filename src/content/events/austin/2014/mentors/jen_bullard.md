A civic minded business woman I have been working to support the video game business ecosystem, and do so through my work on Captivate and the Texas Creative Incubator. These two initiatives have a healthy relationship with each other and I am currently working to develop both in tandem with several awesome people.

This all started when I tried to start my own venture and found little resources available for a fledgling start-up. After looking at the industry as a whole I realized there was a project there, rolled up my sleeves and got started. Now we are at the stage where things are taking shape, with an Incubator spinning up quickly to support creative industries and a conference to captivate professionals, entrepreneurs and educators.

My traditional background is an Executive Producer who has worked on a wide variety of titles, platforms and teams. I have worked well with executives, directors and leads to organize and manage the schedule, keep on budget and satisfy the needs of each individual team member. I possess a strong ability to develop and grow relationships with business partners. My goal is to leverage this background to smooth the communications between start-ups and investors, providing both groups with the support and information they need to be successful.

As the Chapter Chair of IGDA-Austin I have enjoyed building community, developing events and providing support to our local government as a representative of the gaming industry. My goal is to continue to expand the services that IGDA-Austin provides and continue to improve our community.
