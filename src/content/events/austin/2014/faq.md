<p>Yes. We realize that 47 hours is a long time, and that some people might have other commitments, or might prefer to work remotely, or need to go home/hotel to rest and shower. Yet, you need to be present for the initial few hours during the startup demos, and at some point you need be at the venue and do some work onsite. You will also need to be present for the final few hours for the presentations and judging.</p>

<div id="g1-toggle-counter-13" class="g1-toggle g1-toggle--off g1-toggle--solid g1-toggle--noicon "><div class="g1-toggle__title"><span class="g1-toggle__switch"></span>Can I sleep at the venue?</div><div class="g1-toggle__content" style="display: none;"><div class="g1-block">
<p>Yes the venue will be open for the duration of the event, please bring a sleeping bag, a pillow, or whatever you might need, and find a place at the venue to take a good nap.</p>

<div id="g1-toggle-counter-15" class="g1-toggle g1-toggle--off g1-toggle--solid g1-toggle--noicon "><div class="g1-toggle__title"><span class="g1-toggle__switch"></span>Will I meet my team members before the event?</div><div class="g1-toggle__content" style="display: none;"><div class="g1-block">
<p>Possibly. You can use the Code for the Kingdom Google + Community at anytime to meet other participants, propose ideas, and recruit or be recruited into a team. But you can also bring your own team, or come alone and become part of a team at the hackathon.</p>
</div></div></div>
<div id="g1-toggle-counter-16" class="g1-toggle g1-toggle--off g1-toggle--solid g1-toggle--noicon "><div class="g1-toggle__title"><span class="g1-toggle__switch"></span>Can I present a technology I already have?</div><div class="g1-toggle__content" style="display: none;"><div class="g1-block">
<p>You can build on top of something you have, but whatever you present must have new code developed for at least one of the challenges of the hackathon and you must do some of that coding at the hackathon venue during the hackathon hours.</p>
</div></div></div>
<div id="g1-toggle-counter-17" class="g1-toggle g1-toggle--off g1-toggle--solid g1-toggle--noicon "><div class="g1-toggle__title"><span class="g1-toggle__switch"></span>Won’t other teams who are building on top of technologies they already developed, not have an unfair advantage over me who plans to start coding during the actual hackathon hours?</div><div class="g1-toggle__content" style="display: none;"><div class="g1-block">
<p>We don’t think so. There will be separate prizes, but of similar amount, for teams that present solutions built on their existing technologies, and for teams that start fresh at the hackathon. We want to honor all of you, regardless of whether you have been working for a while on something you are passionate about, or whether you decide on something brand new.</p>
</div></div></div>
<div id="g1-toggle-counter-18" class="g1-toggle g1-toggle--off g1-toggle--solid g1-toggle--noicon "><div class="g1-toggle__title"><span class="g1-toggle__switch"></span>Do I have to work non-stop?</div><div class="g1-toggle__content" style="display: none;"><div class="g1-block">
