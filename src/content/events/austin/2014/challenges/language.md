title: Language, Literacy and the Unreached
intro: How can technology promote worldwide biblical literacy? How can technology help people with limited reading skills to understand and engage the Bible?

50% of the world is illiterate and will never be reached with the printed page. And yet, every person has the right to receive God’s Word in their own language because, only God’s truth has the ability to transform the heart and the mind.

Even among the literate, biblical content in their heart language may be scarce and even in languages where there is an abundance of content, many people are not biblically literate.

How can technology promote worldwide biblical literacy? How can technology help people with limited reading skills to understand and engage the Bible?

There is such a thing as “heart language.” These are the thoughts in your head, the phrases you naturally repeat, the songs that make their way from your lips into your psyche. Most of these are first heard with our ears and repeated with our lips.

For the first time in history the Bible in text, audio and video has now been normalized and made available via APIs so YOU can reach 5.7 billion people in over 800 languages. Through the Digital Bible Platform you can integrate the Bible in all of your most effective digital evangelism, discipleship and engagement tools? Faith Comes By Hearing is looking for the most creative ways to apply this platform to reach the World! And they want to support you all the way to accomplish this.

What if people around the world could remember the whole counsel of God in their heart language? Can believers have the promises, reasoning, implications, songs and stories of Scripture readily available in their hearts and minds instead of simply on their smartphones or bookshelves?

Can we build oral translation technology to help multilingual churches thrive and promote the witness of a united church that spans language and cultural barriers?

Can we invent tools that empower people to create multilingual video and audio content that engages people who are not proficient readers with the Scriptures?
