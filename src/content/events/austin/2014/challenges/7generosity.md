Too long the church has focused on a narrow view of generosity dealing solely on the financial giving of adults, and forgotten to teach a holistic view of generosity (generosity of thoughts, time and stuff). Not only this, but the culture of youth and teens is very different than Baby Boomers, who the church has traditionally turned to for support. With the future of the church at stake, how can we properly instill a holistic view of radical generosity in youths and teens by being generous in their thoughts, time, and with their stuff (money included).
