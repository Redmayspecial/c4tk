Foster parents face difficult challenges on a daily basis. Children in foster care often come from traumatic experiences, including physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. On top of dealing with the trauma, gaining  trust, providing at home health care, helping with the education and the recovery of the child, foster parents have to deal with  bureaucratic, underfunded, understaffed, and antiquated legal and social services systems. From having to deal with multiple social workers due to the workers’ high turnover rate, to having to deal with cumbersome State reporting requirements, the administrative tasks of foster parents are very burdensome. 

By helping unburden foster parents from some time wasting processes forced upon them by the foster system, you could improve their lives and free them to give greater focus to the needs of their family, improving the chances of the foster child to adjust, recover, and grow healthier in a loving family. By doing this you could help remove some of the barriers that prevent good people from becoming foster parents. 

Create apps to help reduce the burden and stress on foster parents by making it easier to meet the tracking and reporting requirements of the state.

Create films to bring awareness to the plight of children in the foster care system while recruiting and encouraging foster and adoptive families.

Create games to help foster children in your community overcome trauma, and develop stronger bonds and trust with other members of their foster families
