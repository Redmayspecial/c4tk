Create for the Kingdom is a special Code for the Kingdom event in Austin, TX. It expands the weekend to include Filmmakers and Game Developers along with the traditional Hackathon-ers. During this weekend there will be a Game Jam, Film Challenge and Hackathon, each with prizes (check them out below). We encourage collaboration between all of the disciplines for the purposes of building a long-term ecosystem where global issues are tackled from a Creative Christian perspective. 

“How can all Creatives help alleviate and eradicate injustice, teach God’s unconditional love and build a healthier and stronger society?” That is the question we will answer at Create for the Kingdom.

Join us this September, to foster visionary creatives to create new mediums to transform lives through a holistic Christian approach that combats social injustice, creates a culture of generosity, facilitates spiritual justice and unleashes the fullest capacity of each individual.

The weekend event will focus the passion, purpose, and creativity of our entrepreneurial and creative community, connecting incredible innovators with organizations, and initiatives that need their talent.

Join us at Austin,TX as we battle the challenges confronting our communities, our society, our families, and our spiritual lives.

          <h3>Help Create a culture of Generosity</h3>
        </header>
        <p>The Follower of Christ is called to a life of generous sacrifice extending beyond simple financial generosity, to include generosity of our mind, time and possessions. If the Kingdom of God is to truly to be advanced by us, we need to answer the call of radical generosity. It is only when we live out this radical generosity that the Church will be unleashed in thoughtfulness, action, and resources to advance the Kingdom of God in the world. Create technology, films, and games to encourage individuals and families to become generous in every aspect of their lives.

          <h3>Engaging and Releasing Our best</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Every person has something unique to contribute to the community, society, and church. Yet, most of us do not understand how we can leverage our skills and ideas to improve the lives of others.

What if we could discover how to use our unique gifts for God’s Kingdom? Use technology, films, or games to mobilize and equip every member of your community, church and family. Empower them to release their skills as well as to accelerate great ideas and initiatives that could transform the lives of the child or adult down your street.
