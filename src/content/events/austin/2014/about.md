Create for the Kingdom is a special Code for the Kingdom event in Austin, TX expanding the hackathon concept to include not only Technology, but also other Creative disciplines such as Film and Game Design. During this weekend there will be a 48 hour hackathon for Tech, a 48 hour Film Challenge contest, and a 48 hour Game Jam. We will encourage synergy between all three disciplines for the purposes of activating an ongoing ecosystem where global issues are tackled from a Creative Christian perspective.

We hope to answer the question, "How can all Creatives help alleviate and eradicate all forms of injustices, teach about God’s unconditional love, and build a healthier and stronger society?"

Join us this September, to foster visionary creatives to create new mediums to transform lives through a holistic Christian approach that combats social injustice, creates a culture of generosity, facilitates spiritual justice and unleashes the fullest capacity of each individual.

The weekend event will focus the passion, purpose, and creativity of our entrepreneurial and creative community, connecting incredible innovators with organizations, and initiatives that need their talent.

Join us at Austin,TX as we battle the challenges confronting our communities, our society, our families, and our spiritual lives.

          <h3>SOCIAL JUSTICE</h3>
        </header>
        <p>How can you help alleviate the social maladies that oppress so many? How can you help knock off a little corner of darkness?

Here’s a chance to work with non-profits to help rescue victims of human trafficking across the world, combat poverty, lift the fatherless, release the oppressed, heal the sick, and feed the hungry.

          <h3>SPIRITUAL JUSTICE</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Every person has the right to receive God’s Word and discover His unconditional love, because only God’s truth has the ability to transform the heart and the mind. Join forces with other like minded individuals and create technologies, films, or games to help reduce spiritual poverty in every nation, city, community, family, and individual.

Create to help children learn the Word of God, bury it in their hearts and share it with their friends. Create works for prayer, evangelism, mentorship, and other innovative means to spiritual formation.

          <h3>HELP CREATE A CULTURE OF GENEROSITY</h3>
        </header>
        <p>The Church and non-profits are always significantly underfunded. The Great Commission could be tremendously impacted and enhanced if financial resources were available.  Create new experiences that can help organizations redefine the giving experience for their patrons.  Leverage the power of technology, films, and games to encourage individuals and families to become generous to the causes and churches.

          <h3>ENGAGING AND RELEASING OUR BEST</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
Every person has something unique to contribute to the community, society, and church. Yet, less than 20% of us are actively engaged in doing what we could do. Most of us do not understand how we can leverage our skills and ideas to improve the lives of others.

What if we could discover how to use our unique gifts for God’s Kingdom? Use technology, films, or games to mobilize and equip every member of your community, church and family. Empower them to release their skills as well as to accelerate great ideas and initiatives that could transform the lives of the child or adult down your street.
