At Code For The Kingdom, we value your precious time and don’t want you to reinvent the wheel. That’s why our sponsors have come forward to offer their API, in order to enable you to build better and faster. That said, please note that there is no compulsion that these API must be used or any other restrictions on technologies that you may use at the Hackathon.

We believe that these platforms may assist you as you create effective solutions to today’s problems. We have also instituted cash prizes of $500 for the best usage of each of the two APIs our sponsors have provided. So leverage these API and the best resources around so that together, we can create technology that matters.
