Jennifer Gooding is one of two Principals at PRIME|PR, a fully integrated, boutique communications agency that helps industry leaders expand their business. (Market Segments include Consumer, Deep Tech, Enterprise, Clean Tech, and Nonprofit.) 


The two Principals have a combined 30 years of experience in technology communications, and have featured their clients with prominent coverage in every major media outlet, from CNN and BBC to Tech Crunch and TIME magazine. We are responsible for creating and spotlighting true thought leaders, returning millions of dollars in ROI of earned media. After years of service with one of the oldest and largest nonprofits in the nation, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Los Angeles, Jennifer traded in the bullet proof vest and safety escorts for her car, to continue her path of service in greener, safer pastures.  


She then moved to Malibu and graduated from Pepperdine University with degrees in Public Relations and Nonprofit Management. She is active on over seven boards, advancing Austin as one of the best places to do business and call home and is proud to be a part of Code For The Kingdom.
