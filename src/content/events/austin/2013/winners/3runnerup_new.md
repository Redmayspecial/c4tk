Built in response to the International Justice Mission challenge, UResQ is first a mobile app that individuals in the community can use to alert suspicious activity in their area, with GPS, photo, time of day, video, audio, and text. It also includes an Incident Report Management component used as a control panel by the sex trafficking fighting organizations to dispatch agents to further investigate and disrupt the business of sex trafficking.
