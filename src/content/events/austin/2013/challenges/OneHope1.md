With this challenge, One Hope is looking at a mobile app that feeds into a global map where people check in during sessions of ministering to children with types of ministry being provided to children. This app would achieve the following goals.

    Help us direct children to locations where they can be taught and show us gaps where ministry in unavailable

    Data could be categorized by type of ministry and number of children typically involved

    Frequency of check in at location would communicate frequency/consistency of ministry provision

    Helps potential volunteers and funders find places to support and enables leader to check in with category and numbers

    Helps families learn where the nearest sports ministry or literacy training or grief counseling for children is available.

    Also begins to show where new initiatives and resources might be strategically directed.
