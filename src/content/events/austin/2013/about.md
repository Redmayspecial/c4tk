How can technology help alleviate and eradicate all forms of injustice in a child’s life, while teaching him/her about God’s unconditional love?

Did you know that it is between the ages of 4-14 that over 80% of Christians choose Christ? Children are the biggest mission fields and fertile ground for the Word of God. Now, more than ever before in history, children are learning everything and anything by means of mobile technology even before they learn from their parents or teachers.

This fall, we want to develop new technologies to transform children’s lives through a holistic Christian approach that combats social injustice, creates a culture of generosity, facilitates spiritual justice and unleashes the fullest capacity of each individual.

Code for the Kingdom is a weekend Hackathon where global issues are tackled with a Christian perspective. Join us at Austin, TX as we battle the challenges confronting children all over the world.

        <p>Every person has something unique to contribute to the community, society, and church. Yet, less than 20% of us are actively engaged in doing what we could do. Most of us do not understand how we can leverage our skills and ideas to improve the lives of children other than our own.

What if we could discover how to use our unique gifts for God’s Kingdom? Build technologies to mobilize and equip every member of your community, church and family. Empower them to release their skills as well as to accelerate great ideas and initiatives that could transform the lives of the child down your street.</p></section>

          <h3>HELP CREATE A CULTURE OF GENEROSITY</h3>
        </header>
        <p>The Church and non-profits are always significantly underfunded. The Great Commission could be tremendously impacted and enhanced if financial resources were available. 

What better opportunity than this to cultivate generosity with Generis? Build fresh user experiences that can help organizations redefine the giving experience for their patrons.  Leverage the power of technology to encourage individuals and families to become generous to the causes and churches.

        <p>How can technology alleviate the social maladies that oppress children? How can you help knock off a little corner of darkness?

Here’s a chance to work with International Justice Mission to create apps to fight child trafficking across the world. Build new technologies to combat poverty, lift the fatherless, release the oppressed, heal the sick, and feed the hungry.
