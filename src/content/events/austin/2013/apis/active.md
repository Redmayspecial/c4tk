# The Fellowship One REST API

Fellowship One is a web-based church management software system that allows a church of any size, from new church plants to multi-site mega churches, to be more effective in ministry, more efficient in administration, and more engaged with their communities. Fellowship One provides a unique 360-degree, single view of the involvement and needs of the families in your church so that you can personalize their care.

The Fellowship One REST API is a REST-based web application that uses several open protocols and patterns to enable 3rd party integration with Fellowship One and provide consumers with access to secure resources. We will also award a $500 prize to the best use of the Fellowship One API.
