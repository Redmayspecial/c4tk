###What is Code for the Kingdom?

Are you an entrepreneur, technologist or innovator? Have you ever wanted to impact your cities, circles and communities and solve problems that you see around you? Have you ever wanted to be the change? If yes, join us on May 22-24, 2015 for Orlando’s first Code for the Kingdom Hackathon, hosted by WyCliffe Associates. 

Code for the Kingdom is a weekend Hackathon series and ongoing ecosystem where the challenges confronting our communities, our society, our families, and our spiritual lives are tackled from a Christian perspective. The movement hosts weekend gatherings in different cities where developers, designers, ideators and others collaborate to advance common good and serve God’s Kingdom.

The expansion of Code for the Kingdom to Orlando builds upon the success of previous regional events, which have already gathered over 1000 technologists to create over 100 projects to do good. This first Orlando collaboration will leverage the skills and insights of our entrepreneurs, designers, and technologists to foster an entrepreneurial culture with Christian values and activate technologists to give their skills and some time as their contribution to the mission field.

Join some of the most talented Developers, designers, entrepreneurs, and creative people in the country as they collaborate with each other, investors, mentors, innovative non-profits and churches to create technology to help release the oppressed, teach God’s word, heal the sick, feed the hungry, clothe the naked and support the Church and the body of Christ. 
Join us this March 20-22 and let’s create technology that matters.

          <h3>ENGAGING AND RELEASING OUR BEST</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Every person has something unique to contribute to the community, society, and church. Yet, less than 20% of us are actively engaged in doing what we could do. Most of us do not understand how we can leverage our skills and ideas to improve the lives of others.

What if we could discover how to use our unique gifts for God’s Kingdom? Build technologies to mobilize and equip every member of your community, church and family. Empower them to release their skills as well as to accelerate great ideas and initiatives that could transform the lives of the child or adult down your street.</p></section>

          <h3>SPIRITUAL FORMATION</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Every person has the right to receive God’s Word and discover His unconditional love, because only God’s truth has the ability to transform the heart and the mind. Join forces with other like minded individuals and create technologies that help reduce spiritual poverty in every nation, city, community, family, and individual.

Build mobile applications to help children learn the Word of God, bury it in their hearts and share it with their friends. Create technologies for prayer, evangelism, mentorship, and other innovative means to spiritual formation.

          <h3>HELP CREATE A CULTURE OF GENEROSITY</h3>
        </header>
        <p>The Church and non-profits are always significantly underfunded. The Great Commission could be tremendously impacted and enhanced if financial resources were available.  Build fresh user experiences that can help organizations redefine the giving experience for their patrons.  Leverage the power of technology to encourage individuals and families to become generous to the causes and churches.
