###What is Code for the Kingdom?

Are you an entrepreneur, technologist or innovator? Have you ever wanted to impact your cities, circles and communities and solve problems that you see around you? Have you ever wanted to be the change? If yes, join us on May 22-24, 2015 for Orlando’s first Code for the Kingdom Hackathon, hosted by WyCliffe Associates. 

Code for the Kingdom is a weekend Hackathon series and ongoing ecosystem where the challenges confronting our communities, our society, our families, and our spiritual lives are tackled from a Christian perspective. The movement hosts weekend gatherings in different cities where developers, designers, ideators and others collaborate to advance common good and serve God’s Kingdom.

The expansion of Code for the Kingdom to Orlando builds upon the success of previous regional events, which have already gathered over 1000 technologists to create over 100 projects to do good. This first Orlando collaboration will leverage the skills and insights of our entrepreneurs, designers, and technologists to foster an entrepreneurial culture with Christian values and activate technologists to give their skills and some time as their contribution to the mission field.

Join some of the most talented Developers, designers, entrepreneurs, and creative people in the country as they collaborate with each other, investors, mentors, innovative non-profits and churches to create technology to help release the oppressed, teach God’s word, heal the sick, feed the hungry, clothe the naked and support the Church and the body of Christ. 
Join us this May 22-24 and let’s create technology that matters.

          <h3>SPREAD THE WORD</h3>
        </header>
        <p>At least 1.3 billion people don't have the full Bible in their own language. 7,000 languages are in the world, but only 2888 languages have even just some Scripture translated. Only 531 languages have the complete Bible. Millions of people are waiting for God's Word in the language of their heart. Christian organizations and churches across the globe have united in Vision 2025, the commitment to initiate a translation in all languages which still need the Bible. We have less than 10 years to fulfill our commitment.  
 God is on the move. Breakthrough techniques developed in just the past year are enabling the New Testament to be translated in as little as two weeks with pen and paper. Teams are deploying satellite internet to places that don't even have electricity in order to connect local churches with Bible scholars on other continents. Apps are being developed to equip persecuted Christians in the most difficult parts of the world.
What is accomplished here will transform lives and change the world for Christ. What can you create to accelerate Bible translation?

          <h3>STRONGER & HEALTHIER MINISTRIES</h3>
        </header>
        <p>As ministries flourish, communities thrive and the whole land prospers. Let’s create technologies to increase the impact and reach of ministries, improve how ministry builds and fosters relationship with those who are served and those who serve, and equip leaders for the work of ministry. Bring innovation to all aspects of ministries and help The Church obtain operational excellence.

          <h3>STRONGER & HEALTHIER RELATIONSHIPS</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Regardless of spiritual background, nationality, ethnicity, educational level, or economic status, we all desire deeper, better relationships.  Whether it is between a husband and wife, a parent and child, or the people on our street, we want to invest in those closest to us, but often lack the focus, access to resources, or the accountability necessary to make lasting progress.  But growth in these key relational areas could bring radical change to families, friendships, neighborhoods, communities, churches, and society.  Let’s create technology to cultivate and strengthen some of society's most foundational relationships: marriage, parenthood, family, friendships?

          <h3>ENGAGING AND RELEASING ALL OF US</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Every person has something unique to contribute to the community, society, and church. Yet, less than 20% of us are actively engaged in doing what we could do. Most of us do not understand how we can leverage our skills and ideas to improve the lives of others.

What if we could discover how to use our unique gifts for God’s Kingdom? Build technologies to mobilize and equip every member of your community, church and family. Empower them to release their skills as well as to accelerate great ideas and initiatives that could transform the lives of the people on your community.</p></section>

          <h3>SPIRITUAL FORMATION</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Every person has the right to receive God’s Word and discover His unconditional love, because only God’s truth has the ability to transform the heart and the mind. Join forces with other like minded individuals and create technologies that help reduce spiritual poverty in every nation, city, community, family, and individual.

Build mobile applications to help children learn the Word of God, bury it in their hearts and share it with their friends. Create technologies for prayer, evangelism, mentorship, and other innovative means to spiritual formation.

          <h3>HELP CREATE A CULTURE OF GENEROSITY</h3>
        </header>
        <p>We are all called to a life of generous sacrifice extending beyond simple financial generosity, to include generosity of our mind, love, time and possessions. If the Kingdom of God is to truly to be advanced by us, we need to answer the call of generosity. It is only when we live out this radical generosity that the Church will be unleashed in thoughtfulness, action, and resources to advance the Kingdom of God in the world. Create technology to encourage individuals and families to become generous in every aspect of their lives.</p>

        </header>
        <p>How will you knock off a little corner of darkness in the world? What technologies can you create that will alleviate the social maladies that oppress so many? Work with non-profits to help rescue victims of human trafficking, combat poverty, lift the fatherless, release the oppressed, heal the sick and feed the hungry. Use your skills to create a brighter world and lift up your community.What technologies can you create to affect the life of one lost child in your own neighborhood?
