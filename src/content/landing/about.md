    <h2>What is <strong>Code for the Kingdom?</strong></h2>

    <p>Code for the Kingdom is a weekend hackathon and ongoing ecosystem where global issues are tackled from a Christian perspective.</p>

    <p>Join an incredible group of individuals who are applying their skills and experiences to advance common good and serve God’s Kingdom.
      In collaboration with innovative nonprofits and churches, we’ll write code and create technology to help release the oppressed, teach God’s Word, heal the sick, feed the hungry, clothe the naked, and support the church and the body of Christ.</p>

    <p>Make a difference by writing much-needed code or designing beautiful interfaces. Find a community of peers who want to have fun while serving the Lord.</p>
