Are you an entrepreneur, technologist or innovator? Have you ever wanted to impact your cities, circles and communities and solve problems that you see around you? If yes, don’t miss out on India’s first mission-based weekend Hackathon that kicks off on Oct 31, 2014!</p>
<p>Code for the Kingdom is a weekend Hackathon series and ongoing ecosystem where global issues are tackled from a Christian perspective. The movement hosts weekend gatherings in different cities where developers, designers, ideators and others collaborate to advance common good and serve God’s Kingdom.</p>
<p>Code for the Kingdom hosted its first-of-a-kind mission based weekend Hackathon in San Francisco last year. In the span of a year, the weekend event gathered momentum and members with weekend gatherings across Austin, Seattle and Redwood City. Now, for the first time, Code for the Kingdom is expanding beyond American shores and what better destination to connect technologists than Bangalore, India?</p>
<p>Join the top 100 leaders in the country as they collaborate with innovative non-profits and churches to write code and create technology to help release the oppressed, teach God’s word, heal the sick, feed the hungry, clothe the naked and support the church and the body of Christ. </p>
<p>This weekend event will focus the passion, purpose, and creativity of our entrepreneurial and creative community, connecting incredible innovators with organizations, and initiatives that need their talent.
Join us in Bangalore, India as we battle the challenges confronting our communities, our society, our families, and our spiritual lives.</p>

        </header>
        <p>The Follower of Christ is called to a life of generous sacrifice extending beyond simple financial generosity, to include generosity of our mind, time and possessions. If the Kingdom of God is to truly to be advanced by us, we need to answer the call of radical generosity. It is only when we live out this radical generosity that the Church will be unleashed in thoughtfulness, action, and resources to advance the Kingdom of God in the world. Create technology, films, and games to encourage individuals and families to become generous in every aspect of their lives.

  <div class="content">
    <p>
      Yes. We realize that 46 hours is a long time, and that some people might have other commitments, or might prefer to work remotely, or need to go home/hotel to rest and shower. Yet, you should be present for the initial few hours of the kickoff, and at some point you need be at the venue and do some work onsite. You will also need to be present for the final few hours for the project presentations and judging.

      Not at all. There will be separate prizes, but of similar amount, for teams that present projects built on their existing works, and for teams that start fresh at the event. We want to honor all of you, regardless of whether you have been working for a while on something you are passionate about, or whether you decide on something brand new.
